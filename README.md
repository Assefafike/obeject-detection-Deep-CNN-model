# obeject-detection-Deep-CNN-model
object recognition and localization using pre-trained model 
pre-trained Convolutional Neural Net-works (CNN) MobileNet SSD(Single Shot Multi-Box Detector) model is used to detect object and localize the object within the image boundary by adding abox above the object including the name of the object class and accuracy.  
#to run the code just run : python object_detection_image.py 
python realtime_object_detection.py
