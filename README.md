# obeject-detection-Deep-CNN-model
in this case pre-trained Convolutional Neural Net-works (CNN) MobileNet SSD(Single Shot Multi-Box Detector) model is used to detect object and localize the object within the image boundary by adding abox above the object including the name of the object class and accuracy.  The  mobilenet-ssd  model  is  a  Single-Shot  multibox  Detection  (SSD)  networkintended to perform object detection.  By using SSD, we only need to take onesingle  shot  to  detect  multiple  objects  within  the  image.This  model  is  imple-mented using the Caffe* framework. 
To run the code just RUN : python object_detection_image.py or 
python realtime_object_detection.py
